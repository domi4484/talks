# Speaker Notes

This notes should contain what you can - but not must - tell for each slide.

## QField - Because data is outside

### That's me

### Open source geoninjas
Nine Geo-spatial Experts located in Switzerland.
Everything we do whenever possible we release with open source license.
We do QGIS, QField, PostGIS, Android, Ili2DB, Webmapping ... Training, consultancy and maintenance

## Why QField
Sometimes we have sensors, that deliver data.
But mostly we have people that need to go outside and collect data sometimes in bad weather conditions.

## What is QField
The missing bit on QGIS is that it's not mobile, thats why QField is the ideal side-kic. It's QGIS made for tablets for the mobile data collection.

### Minimalist UI
Everytime when we want to introduce we have big discussion - on the field you just want to be efficient

### Beautiful cartography
we want to allow people to use beautyful cartography
We are using the full QGIS rendering engine - if they look good in QGIS, they do in QField as well

### Powerful tools
See the editing buttons, and the GPS button -> not only because it's a minimalistic tool it does not mean it's lacking of tools

### Efficient interaction
You don't want to waste time when you are in the field. For example here it's a multiple editing. Or another thing is remember value. 
 
### Beneficial integration
Having important integration - adding PDF, open Camera etc. 
 
### Professional hardware
Professional hardware makers are delivering cool android devices - this is a currently tested device. It's a besser reception or you even can use an external GPS antenna and we are Emlid Trimble  
 
### Cloud
is ready seamless integration 

## What can you do with QField
We seperate the project configurator and the endusers "the veggie team" that use the preconfigured project and go outside.
So you can give the project to the people outside.
### Comfortably prepare the work on your QGIS Desktop
Prepare it on QGIS and QFieldSync - usually a team leader does that and the field workers have nothing to do.
Then he uploads to the cloud or copies the project
### Efficiently work on your GIS data outdoor

### Seamlessly syncronize on the device...

## What is in QGIS

### Powerfull forms
Widgets like Value Map, Range Slider (Costraints)
(Remember Attributes if it fits somewhere otherwise just mention)

### Relations
Relation Reference Widget
Value Relation Widget
Relation Editor Widget

### Conditional visibility

### Photo with Camera
and add file

### Multi Edit

### Map Themes
The video is quite fast but I will show it several times.
It shows us how to use **layer visibility** and **map themes**.
Like you see it's what you expect from QGIS here as well.

### Search

### Measure 

### Feature Editing
(topological, snapping, splitting, fill ring, ...)

### Topological Editing

### GPS Tracking
compass, Z values, antenna height correction, ...)

### Freehand drawing

### Print PDF
QField uses the layer layouts configured in QGIS. If you have some, the option is there.
Print to PDF and fine. **Print it with external app**

### Release info
QField is widely used.
This is the current release, and to check out the new feature become a beta tester

There is stuff on the roadmap 

CAD computer-aided drafting implementation
Networkstate based

Full internet connection / or have all the data offline.
Synchronize whenever you are online. And when you go offline, you keep on editing on offline data.

Humidity etc. sensors...

### Custom app
If you need more specific - invest in your custom app
